Just a few notes for anyone who wishes to use this library:
* The library is created from my personal refactorings and merging seperate project's duplicated codes. It's main purpose is personal use so some behavior can be different than expected.

* The library has no default entry point.

* The modules within the library must be imported seperately.

* The modules within the library are as-is and written in EcmaScript 6 so if your target environment uses lower versions of EcmaScript you need to transpile the modules.
